# NobilityItems

Most of Nobility relies on ItemStacks held in memory to spawn output resources. 
Most of these ItemStacks need to be loaded in via YAML. These ItemStacks also 
need to be mapped to Strings so that they can be used in Blueprints, literal 
in-game items with recipes written on them and a limited amount of uses. This
plugin is a unified API for doing just that.
